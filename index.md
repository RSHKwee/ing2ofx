# ING2OFX Introduction

The intent of this (java) application  is to convert ing (www.ing.nl) csv files to ofx files 
that can be read by a program like GnuCash (www.gucash.org).

The origin is a Python script which can be found on Github:  https://github.com/chmistry/ing2ofx/releases.
The original script needed some modifications due to a new Python version and some changes in the ING CSV format.
Due to Python installation problems and integration in Java, this Java applicaton was born.
The Python script(s) are rewritten in Java.

The ofx specification can be downloaded from http://www.ofx.net/

When running the application (Windows excutable or Java jar-file) the following menu is shown:

With the button "CSV File" a ING CSV file can be choosen.
The application recognize a comma or semicolon separated input file, it also recognize a content with "normal" or saving transactions.


In the "settings" menu the following options are available:
- A ING CSV file may contain transactions for more then one account, all converted OFX transcations can be stored in one OFX file or per account a separate OFX file (default).
- The more or less original Python scripts can be used for conversion.
